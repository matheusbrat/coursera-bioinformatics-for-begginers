Exercise Break (2 points): In practice, we retain the best-scoring set of motifs over many runs of RandomizedMotifSearch. Add an input parameter N representing the number of runs of RandomizedMotifSearch, and then find the best-scoring motifs with k-mer length equal to 15 in the DosR dataset over N runs (click here to download). Don't forget to use pseudocounts!
