Now that you know how to work with dictionaries, we can write a Python function that takes a string Text and an integer k as input and returns the Count dictionary for k-mers in Text. The code below uses the notation Count = {} to initialize a blank dictionary containing no items. It also uses PatternCount as a subroutine, or a function that is called within another function. Subroutines are vital to programming because they allow us to reuse code without needing to copy it multiple times.
