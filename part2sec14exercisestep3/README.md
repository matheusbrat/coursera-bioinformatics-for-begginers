We will keep track of the difference between the total number of occurrences of G and the total number of occurrences of C that we have encountered so far in Genome by using a skew array. This array, denoted Skew, is defined by setting Skew[i] equal to the number of occurrences of G minus the number of occurrences of C in the first i nucleotides of Genome (see figure below). We also set Skew[0] equal to zero.
