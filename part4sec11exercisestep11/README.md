Code Challenge (3 points): Write a function GreedyMotifSearchWithPseudocounts(Dna, k, t) that takes a list of strings Dna followed by integers k and t and returns the result of running GreedyMotifSearch, where each profile matrix is generated with pseudocounts. Then add this function to Motifs.py. (Hint: Ideally, you should only need an extremely small modification to your original GreedyMotifSearch function.)
