We now need to simulate rolling a die so that "ccgG" has probability 4/80, "cgGC" has probability 8/80, and so on. We will do so by generating a random number p between 0 and 1. If p is between 0 and 4/80, then it corresponds to "ccgG". If p is between 4/80 and 4/80 + 8/80, then it corresponds to "cgGC", etc.
