Code Challenge (3 points): Now that you have written a function CountWithPseudocounts(Motifs), write a function ProfileWithPseudocounts(Motifs) that takes a list of strings Motifs as input and returns the profile matrix of Motifs with pseudocounts as a dictionary of lists. Then add this function to Motifs.py. Make sure to use CountWithPseudocounts(Motifs) as a subroutine!
